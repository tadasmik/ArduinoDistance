The goal of the arduino object is to detect objects that are within 20 centimeters of the ultrasonic sensor and cause an alarm and sound noise, and display the distance on the LED screen.

Software required is the Arduino IDE, the Crystal Library for the LED screen, and the LED screen, the Arduino Mega 2560 kit, the passive buzzer, the red LED light, the 9V battery with the pin connector, and most importantly the ultrasonic sensor.
